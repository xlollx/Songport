# Google Play listing – texts, answers and checklist

On Google Play the app is **Trackhop** ("SongPort" is an unrelated link converter, see
`docs/ROADMAP.md` › Name). Same code, same package id `com.xlollx.songport`, same signing key as every
other build: the `play` flavor only changes the name (`scripts/play_strings.py`), drops the built-in
web connectors and adds the AdMob banner with the UMP consent form. Upload **only the `play` AAB**
(`Songport-release-aab` artifact of a CI run on `main`, or `Songport-vX-play.aab` in a GitHub Release).

Rule for everything below: the listing describes official-API services and files only. No companion
app, no plugin, no link to one; screenshots taken from the `play` build on a phone without plugins.

## Store listing

### Title (max 30)
- EN: `Trackhop – playlist sync`
- IT: `Trackhop – sync playlist`

### Short description (max 80)
- EN: `Sync playlists across Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music, TIDAL and Deezer.`
- IT: `Playlist sincronizzate tra Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music, TIDAL e Deezer.`

### Full description (EN)
Keep your playlists identical across music services, without rebuilding them by hand.

- Pick a source playlist and a target one, or let the app create it with the same name
- Run the sync whenever you want, or schedule it: hourly, every 6 hours, daily or weekly
- Additions only, or mirror removals too; keep the source order where the service allows it
- Liked songs, saved albums, followed artists and podcasts as sources
- Paste the link of a public playlist, or share it from another app, and sync it into your library
- Preview before every sync: see what will be added or removed, then confirm
- Tracks that were not found are yours to fix: search the target service, pick the right one, the app remembers it
- Playlist generator: describe a playlist, your own AI (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini or any compatible server) proposes the tracks and the app checks they exist before anything is created; extend an existing playlist the same way
- Manage your playlists: rename, delete, make public or private, remove tracks by title, artist or album, remove duplicates
- Files: import and export CSV, M3U, Apple Music/iTunes XML and JSON; dated backups of every playlist, also to a folder of your choice
- Connection test for every account, and a review of every sync

Works with Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music, TIDAL, Deezer, personal Navidrome/Subsonic, Jellyfin
and Plex servers, Last.fm and ListenBrainz as sources, and files. Some connectors are marked beta in
the app: they work, but they have had less use than the others.

Free, no subscriptions, no in-app purchases: the app is supported by a single small banner ad.
No account to create and no server of ours: everything stays on your phone, access tokens are
encrypted with the Android Keystore and never pass through anyone else. You sign in on each
service's own page; for Spotify, YouTube Music, TIDAL and Deezer you create a free key in your own
name in about two minutes, and the app walks you through it.

Scheduled syncs run on your phone, without servers: if the phone is off or battery saving blocks
the app, they resume at the first opportunity.

### Full description (IT)
Tieni le tue playlist uguali su tutti i servizi musicali, senza rifarle a mano.

- Scegli una playlist di origine e una di destinazione, o lasciala creare all'app con lo stesso nome
- Esegui la sincronizzazione quando vuoi, oppure programmala: ogni ora, 6 ore, giorno o settimana
- Solo aggiunte, oppure rispecchia anche le rimozioni; mantieni l'ordine dell'origine dove il servizio lo permette
- Brani preferiti, album salvati, artisti seguiti e podcast come origine
- Incolla il link di una playlist pubblica, o condividila da un'altra app, e sincronizzala nella tua libreria
- Anteprima prima di ogni sync: vedi cosa verrà aggiunto o tolto e confermi
- I brani non trovati li sistemi tu: cerchi sul servizio di destinazione, scegli quello giusto e l'app se lo ricorda
- Generatore di playlist: descrivi una playlist, la tua AI (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini o qualsiasi server compatibile) propone i brani e l'app verifica che esistano prima di creare qualcosa; allo stesso modo allunghi una playlist esistente
- Gestisci le tue playlist: rinomina, elimina, rendi pubblica o privata, rimuovi brani per titolo, artista o album, togli i duplicati
- File: import ed export CSV, M3U, XML di Apple Music/iTunes e JSON; backup datati di ogni playlist, anche in una cartella a tua scelta
- Prova del collegamento per ogni account, e revisione di ogni sync

Compatibile con Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music, TIDAL, Deezer, server personali
Navidrome/Subsonic, Jellyfin e Plex, Last.fm e ListenBrainz come sorgenti, e file. Alcuni connettori
sono indicati come beta nell'app: funzionano, ma sono stati usati meno degli altri.

Gratuita, senza abbonamenti né acquisti in-app: l'app si sostiene con un solo piccolo banner
pubblicitario. Nessun account da creare e nessun server nostro: tutto resta sul tuo telefono, i token
di accesso sono cifrati con l'Android Keystore e non passano da nessun altro. Accedi sulla pagina di
ogni servizio; per Spotify, YouTube Music, TIDAL e Deezer crei una chiave gratuita a tuo nome in
circa due minuti, e l'app ti guida passo passo.

Le sincronizzazioni programmate girano sul tuo telefono, senza server: se il telefono è spento o il
risparmio energetico blocca l'app, ripartono alla prima occasione utile.

Trackhop non è affiliata a Spotify, Apple, Google/YouTube, TIDAL o Deezer. I nomi dei servizi sono
marchi dei rispettivi proprietari e sono usati solo per indicare la compatibilità.

### Category and tags
Application · **Music & Audio** · tags: Music, Playlists, Productivity. Free app, contains ads.

### Graphics
- Icon 512×512: `docs/store/icon512.png` (also `fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/icon.png`).
- Feature graphic 1024×500: `docs/store/feature_en.png`, `feature_it.png` (they say Songport: regenerate
  with "Trackhop" before uploading, or upload without text).
- Phone screenshots: 2 to 8, JPEG/PNG, 320–3840 px per side, **long side at most twice the short
  one**. The F-Droid captures in `fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/` are
  1080×2340 and taller (two are 1080×3755 and 1080×2659), so Play refuses them as they are, and they
  show the Songport name. Take fresh ones from the `play` build and run
  `scripts/play_screenshots.sh <files>`: it crops anything taller than 2:1, keeping the top, into a
  `play/` folder next to the originals.
- No service logos anywhere (icon, screenshots, feature graphic): names in text only.

## App content (Play Console › Policy › App content)

| Declaration | Answer |
|---|---|
| Privacy policy | URL of the published `docs/privacy-policy.md` (it names both Songport and Trackhop). Same URL as the `PRIVACY_POLICY_URL` repository variable, which the app shows in Settings. |
| Ads | **Yes**, the app contains ads (AdMob banner, one per screen at most). |
| App access | **All or some functionality is restricted**. Instructions for the reviewer: "Every feature can be exercised with playlist files (Files › Import, or share a text with one track per line) without any account. Music services require the reviewer's own account and, for Spotify, YouTube Music, TIDAL and Deezer, a free developer key created through the in-app wizard (about two minutes). No credentials can be supplied by the developer: the app has no accounts of its own." |
| Content rating (IARC) | Category **Utility, Productivity, Communication or Other**. Violence, sexuality, language, controlled substances: none. Users cannot interact with or share content with other users: **No**. Shares location: **No**. Digital purchases: **No**. Contains ads: **Yes**. Expected result: PEGI 3 / Everyone. |
| Target audience | **18 and over** only (optionally 16–17 too). Not designed for children; the app then needs no Families policy and the ads can stay personalised. "Could the store listing unintentionally appeal to children?" **No**. |
| News app | No. |
| COVID-19 contact tracing | No. |
| Data safety | See the next section. |
| Government app | No. |
| Financial features | None. |
| Health | None. |
| Advertising ID | **Yes**, the app uses the advertising ID (Google Mobile Ads SDK, which declares `com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID`). Purposes: advertising or marketing; analytics; fraud prevention. |
| Foreground service permissions | Type **`dataSync`** (`FOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNC`). Task: "user-initiated and scheduled playlist synchronisation between music services; a sync of a large playlist can exceed the background work limits and would otherwise be killed half-way, leaving the target playlist inconsistent". Play asks for a short video showing the feature: record a sync from Syncs › Run (the notification appears) with any screen recorder and upload it unlisted on YouTube or Drive. |
| Photo and video permissions | Not applicable: files are chosen through the system picker (Storage Access Framework), no `READ_MEDIA_*` permission. |

Permissions in the manifest, for reference: INTERNET, ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE, POST_NOTIFICATIONS
(asked on first use, not at start), WAKE_LOCK, USE_BIOMETRIC, FOREGROUND_SERVICE,
FOREGROUND_SERVICE_DATA_SYNC, plus AD_ID merged in by the ads SDK.

## Data safety – answers

The app itself collects nothing: no account, no server, no analytics, no crash reporting. What is
declared comes from the Google Mobile Ads SDK alone, as in Google's own data disclosure for AdMob
(check their page when filling the form, the list moves).

- Does your app collect or share any of the required user data types? **Yes**.
- Is all of the user data collected by your app encrypted in transit? **Yes**.
- Do you provide a way for users to request that their data is deleted? The developer holds no data at
  all; the ads data is tied to the advertising ID, which the user resets or deletes in Android
  settings, and the user can refuse or withdraw consent in Settings › Ads. Answer **Yes** and point to
  that in the explanation, or **No** with the note that no data is retained by the developer: both are
  honest, the first reads better.

| Data type | Collected | Shared | Purpose | Optional? | Processed ephemerally |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Location › Approximate location (derived from IP by the ads SDK) | yes | yes (Google) | advertising, analytics, fraud prevention | yes (consent can be refused; the banner then shows non-personalised ads) | no |
| Device or other IDs (advertising ID) | yes | yes (Google) | advertising, analytics, fraud prevention | yes | no |
| App activity › App interactions (ad views and taps) | yes | yes (Google) | advertising, analytics | yes | no |
| App info and performance › Diagnostics | yes | yes (Google) | analytics, fraud prevention | yes | no |

Not collected: personal info, financial info, health, messages, photos, audio, files, contacts,
calendar, browsing history, search history, installed apps. Playlist contents, tokens and the AI key
stay on the device; the AI prompt goes only to the AI provider the user configured, which is a
service the user chose and signed up with, not a collection by the app.

## Release checklist

The order matters: a personal developer account cannot publish to production until a closed test
has run.

1. **Developer account** (play.google.com/console): one-time 25 USD fee, identity check with an ID
   document, phone and e-mail verification. The developer name and a contact e-mail are shown on the
   listing; the console says during sign-up which other details become public for your account type.
2. **Create the app**: name *Trackhop*, default language English (United States), App, Free. Declare
   it has ads. Add Italian as a second listing language.
3. **Store listing**: texts above, icon, feature graphic, screenshots (see Graphics), category, contact
   e-mail, privacy policy URL.
4. **App content**: every row of the table above, in one sitting (the console blocks releases while
   any declaration is missing).
5. **Build to upload**: the `Songport-release-aab` artifact of a green CI run on `main` (flavor `play`,
   release, signed with the upload key from the `UPLOAD_KEYSTORE_*` secrets). Each upload must carry
   a higher `versionCode` than the last one accepted, so bump `android/app/build.gradle` before the
   next upload once a build has gone to any track (the F-Droid version keeps the same numbers).
   **Play App Signing** is proposed at the first upload: accept it; Google keeps the app signing key
   and the key in the secrets stays the upload key. Only if a shared `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` is shipped do
   the SHA-1s of both keys (Setup › App signing) need registering in the Google OAuth client.
6. **Closed testing**: create a closed track, upload the AAB, add testers as an e-mail list or Google
   Group, send them the opt-in link; the console states the current requirement (12 testers opted in
   for 14 continuous days at the time of writing; it was 20 before). Testers install from Play, so
   they must uninstall the GitHub/F-Droid Songport first if they want both: same package id.
7. **Apply for production access** when the test is complete (Dashboard › Apply for production): a few
   questions on who tested, what they found and how it was fixed. Google answers within a few days.
8. **Production release**: upload the AAB (a newer one if the version moved on), release notes
   (`fastlane/metadata/android/*/changelogs/<versionCode>.txt` is a good start), countries (all),
   roll out. First review takes from a few hours to a week.
9. **AdMob**: AdMob account, app *Trackhop* (Android), one banner ad unit; the ids go to the repository
   variables `ADMOB_APP_ID` and `ADMOB_BANNER_ID` before the production build (without them the build
   uses Google's test ids, which is fine for the closed test). Publish the GDPR message under
   Privacy & messaging (the app shows it through UMP). After the listing is live, link the AdMob app
   to the Play listing.
10. **Later**: keep `docs/privacy-policy.md` online at the same URL; every release goes through CI the
    same way, and the AAB keeps the same upload key.

Repository settings already in place: `UPLOAD_KEYSTORE_BASE64`, `UPLOAD_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`,
`UPLOAD_KEY_ALIAS`, `UPLOAD_KEY_PASSWORD` (the AAB artifact proves it), `DEBUG_KEYSTORE_BASE64`,
`PRIVACY_POLICY_URL`, `KOFI_URL`; optional `APPLE_DEVELOPER_TOKEN` (JWT, expires in 6 months) and
the service client ids, which users can replace with their own in the app.

Before the first production upload, tested on the `play` build: AdMob consent form with an EU VPN
(and the banner showing test ads), Spotify login with a user's own key, Apple Music login, manual
sync, scheduled sync (wait one hour), import from a public link, file import/export, playlist
generator with a free Gemini key.
