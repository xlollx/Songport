# The `trackhop` command

Trackhop Desktop and the Docker server come with a command line, `trackhop`: start syncs, see how
they went, list playlists, add and remove tracks, from a terminal, a script, a cron job or Windows'
Task Scheduler. It talks to the Trackhop that is running: on the same computer, or inside the same
container, it needs nothing set up.

```
trackhop syncs                     # every sync, with its last result
trackhop run "Road trip" --wait    # run one and wait for the result
trackhop run --all                 # run every sync that is turned on
trackhop add spotify "Focus" "Bonobo - Kerala" https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=…
```

## Where it is

| Where Trackhop runs | The command |
|---|---|
| Docker | `docker exec trackhop trackhop …` (the container's name, then the command) |
| Windows, installed with Scoop | `trackhop …` |
| Windows, installer (.msi) | `"%LOCALAPPDATA%\Trackhop\trackhop-cli.exe" …` |
| Windows, portable (.zip) | `trackhop-cli.exe` in the `Trackhop` folder |
| macOS | `/Applications/Trackhop.app/Contents/MacOS/trackhop-cli …` |
| Linux, .deb | `/opt/trackhop/bin/trackhop-cli …` |
| Linux, .tar.gz | `Trackhop/bin/trackhop-cli` where you unpacked it |

On Windows the program itself is `Trackhop.exe`, so the command is `trackhop-cli`. To type just
`trackhop`, add an alias: in PowerShell, `Set-Alias trackhop "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Trackhop\trackhop-cli.exe"`
in your profile; in bash, `alias trackhop=/opt/trackhop/bin/trackhop-cli` in `~/.bashrc`.

Trackhop has to be running: Desktop next to the clock, or the container. The command finds it
through a key Trackhop makes at each start and leaves in its data folder (`cli.json`, readable by
your user only), accepted from this computer only. When Trackhop is not running, the command says so.

On a server shared by [several people](docker#several-people-on-one-server), `--user NAME` (or
`TRACKHOP_USER`) picks whose Trackhop: `docker exec trackhop trackhop --user anna run --all`.
Without it, the admin's.

## Commands

**Syncs**

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `trackhop syncs` | Every sync: its route, schedule, last run and result, next run. |
| `trackhop show <sync>` | One sync, with its last runs. |
| `trackhop run <sync>…` | Starts these syncs. `--wait` waits until they end and prints the result. |
| `trackhop run --all` | Starts every sync that is turned on (with `--wait` too). |
| `trackhop enable <sync>`, `trackhop disable <sync>` | Turns a sync's schedule on or off. |

A `<sync>` is its name, the start of its name, or its id. When a name could mean more than one sync,
the command lists them and asks you to say which.

**Services and playlists**

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `trackhop services` | The services you added, and whether they are connected. |
| `trackhop playlists <service>` | A service's playlists, with their ids. |
| `trackhop tracks <service> <playlist>` | A playlist's tracks. |
| `trackhop add <service> <playlist> <track>…` | Adds tracks. A track is `"Artist - Title"` (searched and matched as a sync does), a link from any service, or its id on that service. Tracks already there are not added again. |
| `trackhop remove <service> <playlist> <track>…` | Removes tracks, named the same way. |
| `trackhop create <service> <name>` | A new playlist. |

A `<service>` is its name or id (`spotify`, `tidal`, `subsonic`…, as `trackhop services` shows); a
`<playlist>` its name or id.

**Files and backups**

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `trackhop files` | The playlist files of the File service. |
| `trackhop import <file>` | A playlist file into the File service: CSV, M3U, XSPF, JSPF, iTunes XML, JSON or text. |
| `trackhop backup` | Backs up every playlist now (`--wait` to wait for the end). |
| `trackhop config [<file>]` | Your whole set-up as one file, as Backup & restore makes it; to the screen without `<file>`. |

**Other:** `trackhop status` (version, syncs, what is running), `trackhop help`, `trackhop --version`.

## In scripts

- `--json` prints what the API answers, for `jq` or your own code.
- The exit code: `0` done, `1` failed (a sync that ended with an error, a call refused, a sync or
  playlist not found), `2` wrong use, `3` no Trackhop reached.

```
# Every night at 3, in cron: run everything and keep a log.
0 3 * * * docker exec trackhop trackhop run --all --wait >> /var/log/trackhop.log 2>&1
```

## A server elsewhere

To drive a Trackhop server from another computer, make a token on its page (**Tools › API**) and
give the command its address and the token:

```
trackhop --url https://trackhop.example.org --token th_… syncs
```

or set `TRACKHOP_URL` and `TRACKHOP_TOKEN`. The command is the same program as on the server, so
any Trackhop Desktop has it; or call the [API](docker#api) directly.
