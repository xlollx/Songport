# NetEase Cloud Music and QQ Music: public playlists as a source

[中文说明](netease-qq-music-zh)

Neither NetEase Cloud Music (网易云音乐) nor QQ Music has an official interface for apps like
Trackhop, and neither needs one for this: a **public playlist link** becomes the source of a sync
towards any other service, Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music, TIDAL, Deezer, Navidrome, Jellyfin,
Plex or a playlist file, with no account on the Chinese side.

Only in the GitHub/F-Droid build, in Docker and in Trackhop Desktop downloaded from this site. The
Google Play and Microsoft Store builds carry official connectors only, so they do not have it.

## Use a link

1. In the NetEase Cloud Music or QQ Music app, open the playlist and **Share → Copy link**. These
   are recognised:
   - NetEase: `https://music.163.com/#/playlist?id=…`, `https://music.163.com/playlist?id=…`,
     the mobile `https://y.music.163.com/m/playlist?id=…` and the app's share text
     (`https://music.163.com/playlist/…/…/?userid=…`);
   - QQ Music: `https://y.qq.com/n/ryqq/playlist/…`, the older `https://y.qq.com/n/yqq/playlist/….html`
     and the app's share link (`https://i.y.qq.com/n2/m/share/details/taoge.html?…&id=…`).
2. In Trackhop, start a new sync and paste the link as the source (or share it to Trackhop from
   the music app: the editor opens with it). Pick the destination as usual.
3. The sync runs like any other, by hand or on a schedule: a playlist that grows on the Chinese
   side keeps growing on the other.

On the [server](docker) and in Trackhop Desktop, pick **NetEase Cloud Music (public links,
unofficial)** or **QQ Music (public links, unofficial)** as the source of a new sync and paste the
link in the next step.

## What to expect

- **Read-only.** NetEase and QQ Music are never destinations: nothing is ever written there, and
  Trackhop never asks for a Chinese account.
- **Matching** is by title, artist and duration; there is no ISRC on either side. Chinese,
  Japanese and Korean releases usually carry the same title on Spotify, Apple Music and YouTube
  Music, so most tracks match at once; a track with a romanised or translated title elsewhere ends
  up in the review screen, where you pick the right one.
- **Greyed-out tracks.** A NetEase track that is no longer licensed there is listed anyway and
  marked unavailable, like Spotify's greyed-out tracks: it is still searched on the destination.
- **Long playlists** are read whole, up to 10,000 tracks (NetEase lists them all in one call and
  fetches the details in batches; QQ Music hands them over 30 at a time).

## When it fails

- *"This NetEase Cloud Music playlist is private or doesn't exist: only public links work"* (or
  the same for QQ Music): the playlist is private, was deleted, or the link is mistyped. Ask its
  owner to make it public, or share it from the app again.
- *"NetEase Cloud Music changed its site; Trackhop needs an update"* (or QQ Music): Trackhop reads
  the link the way the site's own pages do, not through an official interface, and the site
  changed something. Update Trackhop when a new version is out, or [report it](reporting-a-problem).
- The link is recognised but belongs to the other service: pick the matching source first. In the
  app the source is chosen from the link itself, so this only happens on the server's form.
