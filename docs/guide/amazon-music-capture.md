# Amazon Music capture

Amazon has no open API for independent apps (its Web API is a closed beta for approved partners;
access was requested in October 2026, case 22725377691). The connector therefore speaks the same
interface as Amazon's own web player, and has to follow it when Amazon changes it. That happened in
October 2026, when the player moved from the "skill" API (`*.web.skill.music.a2z.com/api/…`) to
GraphQL (`gql.music.amazon.<tld>`, persisted queries).

## Signs that Amazon changed something

- *"Amazon Music updated its web player (… is no longer known)"*: a persisted query hash changed.
- *"the Amazon Music player loaded but made no calls … [requests: …]"*: the player now calls
  somewhere else; the list says where.
- The sign-in screen stays on the player and never closes by itself.

## Capturing the player's calls

1. *Settings → Developer options* on.
2. *Accounts → Amazon Music → Capture traffic*: the real web player opens inside the app.
3. Tap **Clear**, then do, in order: open *Library → Playlists*; open one of your playlists and scroll
   to the end; search for a song; create a test playlist; add a song to it; remove it; rename the
   playlist (if the site allows it); delete it.
4. Tap **Share** and attach the file to an issue (or send it to the maintainer).

What the file holds: the URL, method, request body and response of every call to Amazon's music
APIs, and the request's HTTP headers. Cookies are never written; credential headers (authorization,
tokens, CSRF, session) are replaced by their length, and access tokens, bearer tokens and JWTs are
blanked anywhere in the file.

## Updating the connector

`android/bridge/src/main/java/com/xlollx/songport/ytmbridge/AmazonClient.kt`:

- `HASHES` maps each operation name to its persisted-query hash: a changed hash is a one-line fix.
- Operations used: `AddToPlaylistModalUserPlaylists` (the user's playlists), `playlistDetail`
  (tracks, 100 per page, `afterCursor`), `SpecSearchPage` (search, songs only), `CreatePlaylist`,
  `addTrackToPlaylist` (`DUPLICATE_TRACK` is not a failure), `removeTrackFromPlaylist` (by entry
  cursor `index:uuid`, highest index first), `deletePlaylist`.
- Headers are rebuilt from the page configuration (`amznMusic.appConfig`: CSRF triple, device id and
  type, session id from the cookie) plus the player's application key; when Amazon refuses them, the
  headers mirrored from the real player (`AmazonBridge.HOOK`) are used.
