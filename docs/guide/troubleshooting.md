# Troubleshooting

Every error shown in the app is also in *Settings → Diagnostics*. If what you see is not here, see
[Reporting a problem](reporting-a-problem).

## Spotify

**"Spotify refused the request (Forbidden)" with your own key.** Apps in Spotify's *Development Mode*
serve only the accounts listed in the app's *User Management* on developer.spotify.com, and cannot
read playlists made by Spotify itself (Discover Weekly, Release Radar, editorial mixes). Add your
account there, or use a playlist made by you or another user, or use the quick route (*Spotify (web)*).

**"Spotify did not hand out a token".** The web session needs a fresh sign-in: *Accounts → Spotify
(web) → Disconnect*, then connect again.

## Apple Music

**"The library requires an active Apple Music subscription" (CloudLibrary).** Apple only lets
subscribers read and edit a library. Without a subscription Apple Music cannot be a source or a target.

**Tracks are not removed from Apple Music.** Apple's API cannot remove tracks from a playlist: mirror
syncs towards Apple Music only add, and the report says so.

## Amazon Music

**"The Amazon session has expired" / "served the player to a signed-out visitor".** *Accounts → Amazon
Music → Disconnect*, then connect again. If the sign-in screen does not close by itself, tap *Done*.

**"Amazon Music updated its web player (… is no longer known)".** Amazon changed its player; the
connector needs an update. See [Amazon Music capture](amazon-music-capture) and open an issue.

**Renaming and visibility are missing for Amazon playlists.** Not available since Amazon's October
2026 player: their calls have not been seen yet.

## YouTube Music

**Long pauses during a big first sync.** Google slows down an address after many searches; the app
waits the time it is told and resumes. A first sync of a thousand tracks can take an hour or two;
later runs only search what is new.

**Official route: "quota exceeded".** The YouTube Data API allows about 100 searches a day per key.
Use the quick route for big playlists.

## Scheduled syncs do not run

Some phones (Samsung, Xiaomi, Huawei, Oppo) stop background apps. *Settings → Battery* excludes
Songport from battery optimisation. A scheduled run the system interrupts resumes by itself
("paused by the system … will resume" in the log is normal).

## A sync wants to remove many tracks

With *mirror removals* on, a run that would remove a quarter of the target or more is held back
("Removals held back"). Open the **preview**: if the source really lost those tracks, apply it; if
not, the service listed the source incompletely and nothing should be removed. Duplicates in the
target (the same song twice, in two versions) also show up here.

## A pasted link is not recognised

Use the playlist's share link (open.spotify.com/playlist/…, music.youtube.com/playlist?list=…,
music.apple.com/…, short spotify links too). Album and artist links are not playlists.

## Pause and stop do not react at once

They act between steps. While one long step runs (reading a big playlist, starting a web player) the
card says "after the current step".
