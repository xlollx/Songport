# Is Trackhop safe?

Every file of every release, the Android app and Trackhop Desktop, is checked on
[VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com) as soon as it is published: the antivirus engines VirusTotal
runs look at it, and the results are linked below and in the release's notes on GitHub.

<div id="vt" class="vt" aria-live="polite">
  <p class="muted">Loading the latest results… If nothing appears, every release's notes on
  <a href="https://github.com/xlollx/Trackhop/releases">GitHub</a> have them too.</p>
</div>

The SHA-256 next to each file is its fingerprint: the file you downloaded is the one checked when
its own SHA-256 is the same (on Windows `certutil -hashfile <file> SHA256`, on macOS and Linux
`shasum -a 256 <file>`).

## How Trackhop is built

- **Open source.** All the code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/xlollx/Trackhop), under the GPL-3.0.
- **Built in public.** Every file of a release is built by GitHub Actions from the code of that
  release's commit, and the build logs are public. Nothing is built on a personal computer.
- **F-Droid builds it again.** F-Droid compiles the Android app from the source on its own servers
  and checks that the result matches the published APK, byte for byte.
- **The Android app's signature**, the same on GitHub, F-Droid and Obtainium (SHA-256 of the signing
  certificate):
  `21:EA:DF:26:8C:72:F8:55:65:96:1A:60:45:BF:4B:E5:AB:AF:25:6D:68:0D:1E:0D:80:8D:93:ED:22:D3:50:32`.
  Android refuses an update signed with any other key.

## Why Windows or macOS may still warn you

Trackhop Desktop is not signed with a paid Microsoft or Apple certificate yet, so Windows SmartScreen
may say it does not know the publisher, and macOS asks you to open it from *Privacy & Security* the
first time ([how](desktop#macos)). That is about who signed the file, not about what is inside it:
the VirusTotal results above are about what is inside. Now and then a single engine flags an
unsigned installer with a generic "unknown program" verdict; the report shows which engine and why,
and the badge then says "checked" instead of "clean".
