# Connector plugins

Trackhop talks to music services through their official APIs. Some services have no open API, or
make the official route heavy for a single user (a developer account, a paid program, a daily quota).
For those, Trackhop defines an **open connector interface**: a separate Android app, a *plugin*, can
hold the login to a service and answer Trackhop's requests for playlists and tracks. Trackhop does not
include, download or install plugins; it discovers one that is already installed and offers its
services in the account picker.

## How a plugin is discovered

A plugin declares an activity that handles the intent action `com.xlollx.songport.action.CONNECTOR`
and carries a `<meta-data>` entry named `com.xlollx.songport.connector.authority` with the authority of
its `ContentProvider`. Trackhop calls that provider with `ContentResolver.call()`; the methods and their
arguments are documented in the reference implementation below. The provider must verify the caller's
package and signing certificate before answering.

## Known plugins

### Trackhop Bridge

[Trackhop Bridge](https://github.com/xlollx/Trackhop-Bridge) is the reference plugin, by the same
author, free and open source (GPL-3.0). It is distributed on GitHub only, never on Google Play.
It adds:

- **YouTube Music** without a Google Cloud project and without quota.
- **Amazon Music**, which has no open API at all.
- **Spotify** and **Apple Music** sign-in without creating a developer app or paying for the Apple
  Developer Program (the official routes stay available in Trackhop).
- **Deezer** sign-in (alpha) for people who cannot create a Deezer developer app, now that Deezer no
  longer registers new ones (the official route stays available in Trackhop).
- **SoundCloud** with your account (beta): your sets and liked tracks as sources and destinations,
  and public SoundCloud links.

Read this before installing: the Bridge uses the same web interfaces the services' own web players use,
not official APIs. That is against those services' terms of use, it can stop working whenever a service
changes something, and in the worst case a service could restrict the account you sign in with. The
Bridge shows a notice and asks for your acceptance before any sign-in. Your passwords are typed only on
the services' own pages and are never stored; the Bridge keeps the session cookies, encrypted on the
phone, and hands Trackhop only the data or short-lived tokens it needs.

**The Trackhop APK from GitHub and the F-Droid version already include these connectors**: add the
service from Accounts → + and sign in there, the notice comes first. The separate Bridge app is only
for the Google Play version of Trackhop:
[latest release](https://github.com/xlollx/Trackhop-Bridge/releases/latest).

## Methods

Every method is a `ContentResolver.call(authority, method, arg, extras)`. The answer is a `Bundle`:
`error` (a message to show as is) when the call failed, otherwise the fields below. Listings are
JSON in `json`; playlists are `{id, name, count, owned, description}`; tracks are
`{id, title, artists, album, durationMs, setVideoId, uri, explicit, addedAt, kind, year, available, isrc}`
unless said otherwise. Long listings come in pages: `tracks` methods take `offset` and answer
`json`, `total` and, when more follow, `next`.

Every service has `<service>.status` (`connected`, `account`, `version`: the plugin's versionCode)
and `<service>.disconnect`. Trackhop treats a service as served when its status answers `connected`
at all; a plugin that does not know a service answers `error`.

| Namespace | Methods |
|-----------|---------|
| (none) YouTube Music | `status`, `disconnect`, `playlists`, `playlistInfo`, `tracks`, `search`, `stats`, `create`, `add`, `remove`, `rename`, `delete`, `visibility`, `reorder` |
| `amazon.` | `status`, `disconnect`, `playlists`, `tracks`, `search`, `create`, `add`, `remove`, `rename`, `delete`, `visibility` |
| `spotify.` | `status`, `disconnect`, `token`, `playlists`, `version`, `playlistInfo`, `tracks`, `search`, `track`, `create`, `add`, `remove`, `rename`, `delete`, `visibility`, `reorder` |
| `apple.` | `status`, `disconnect`, `tokens` |
| `deezer.` | `status`, `disconnect`, `playlists`, `playlistInfo`, `version`, `tracks`, `search`, `track`, `create`, `add`, `remove`, `rename`, `delete` |
| `soundcloud.` | `status`, `disconnect`, `playlists`, `playlistInfo`, `version`, `tracks`, `search`, `create`, `add`, `remove`, `reorder`, `rename`, `visibility`, `delete` |

### Deezer (`deezer.*`, Trackhop Bridge 1.5.0)

The web player's gateway for the account, Deezer's public catalogue API for search. Ids are Deezer's
track and playlist ids (the same as the official API's). `__liked__` is the favourite tracks.

| Method | `arg` | `extras` | Answer |
|--------|-------|----------|--------|
| `deezer.playlists` | | | `json`: playlists, without the "Loved tracks" one |
| `deezer.playlistInfo` | playlist id | | `json`: one playlist |
| `deezer.version` | playlist id or `__liked__` | | `version`: a checksum that changes with the content |
| `deezer.tracks` | playlist id or `__liked__` | `offset` | `json` (tracks, with `isrc`), `total`, `next` |
| `deezer.search` | query | `isrc` (optional) | `json`: tracks; by ISRC first when given |
| `deezer.track` | track id | | `json`: one track, or `null` |
| `deezer.create` | | `name`, `description` | `json`: the new playlist (private) |
| `deezer.add` / `deezer.remove` | playlist id or `__liked__` | `ids` (track ids) | empty; removal is by track id |
| `deezer.rename` | playlist id | `name` | empty |
| `deezer.delete` | playlist id | | empty |

### SoundCloud (`soundcloud.*`, Trackhop Bridge 1.5.0)

`api-v2.soundcloud.com` with the web app's client id and the account's OAuth token. A playlist id is
a numeric set id, `__liked__` for the liked tracks, or the path of a public page (`user/sets/slug`,
`user/likes`, read-only). Tracks are **SoundCloud's own track objects**, trimmed to `id`, `kind`,
`title`, `user.username`, `publisher_metadata` (`artist`, `album_title`, `isrc`, `explicit`),
`duration`, `full_duration`, `permalink_url`, `policy`, `release_date`, `display_date`,
`created_at`, plus `liked_at` for liked tracks: Trackhop reads them with the same parser as public
SoundCloud links.

| Method | `arg` | `extras` | Answer |
|--------|-------|----------|--------|
| `soundcloud.playlists` | | | `json`: own sets, then liked sets (`owned` false) |
| `soundcloud.playlistInfo` | set id or page path | | `json`: one playlist |
| `soundcloud.version` | set id or page path | | `version`: last modification and size (none for likes) |
| `soundcloud.tracks` | set id, `__liked__` or page path | `offset` | `json` (track objects), `total`, `next` |
| `soundcloud.search` | query | | `json`: track objects |
| `soundcloud.create` | | `name`, `description` | `json`: the new set (private) |
| `soundcloud.add` | set id or `__liked__` | `ids` | empty; appended to the set (500 tracks at most) |
| `soundcloud.remove` | set id or `__liked__` | `ids` | empty; every copy of each track leaves the set |
| `soundcloud.reorder` | set id | `ids`: the set's full track list in the new order | empty; refused when the set changed |
| `soundcloud.rename` | set id | `name` | empty |
| `soundcloud.visibility` | set id | `public` | empty |
| `soundcloud.delete` | set id | | empty |

Sign-in activities are started with the actions `com.xlollx.songport.ytmbridge.DEEZER_LOGIN` and
`com.xlollx.songport.ytmbridge.SOUNDCLOUD_LOGIN` (next to `LOGIN`, `AMAZON_LOGIN`, `SPOTIFY_LOGIN`
and `APPLE_LOGIN`). Before the first Deezer or SoundCloud sign-in the notice is shown again, since
its text now names them.
